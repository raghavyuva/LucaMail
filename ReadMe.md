# About The Project

 <p align="center"><a href="https://youtu.be/Nr4P234WgV0"><img src="https://imgur.com/tt1JqSC.png"></a></p>
 
LucaMail is an Open Source, Cross-Platform Email Client. LucaMail is developed to provide a cross-platform alternative to Email Clients that already exists. LucaMail focuses on contemporary technologies as well as maintaining a user-friendly UI. There exist Email Clients which lack providing cross-platform software, smooth UI, modern design techniques, and trending technologies. Whereas a solution *LucaMail* provides all such features. LucaMail is bundled with 2 classic dark and light themes along with a customized theme. LucaMail is lightweight, simple, OS friendly too.
LucaMail provides a Rich Text Editing Experience to send Mail. Only the `IMAP protocol` is supported in the beta version as many users don't seem to be using a POP protocol. LucaMail stores the messages as files under the user's home directory moved by the `luca` directory.

Some features may be lacking as it is a beta version but the bundled features are assumed to work in all perspectives as long as a bug is detected.
